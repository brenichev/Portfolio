HongKong'sgroundbreakingentryintothebig-budgetCGIsci-fifilmmaking.It'sentertaining,butthescriptleavesmuchmoretobedesired. (6/10)
||Warriors of Future, the long-awaited dream project from producer and actor Louis Koo, is a Hong Kong sci-fi action film that delivers on its initial attempt at CGI spectacle.
||It is a groundbreaking entry for Hong Kong cinema, catapulting into the realm of the big-budget CGI blockbuster filmmaking.In the year 2055 on an environmentally-damaged and war-torn Earth, a meteorite strikes a futuristic Hong Kong, now known as B-16 district.
||A giant alien plant, named Pandora, has rapidly grown out from the rubble, causing devastation but also purifying the air.
||Scientists have devised a missile to alter the genetic makeup of Pandora to stop its growth and keep purifying the air.
||Tyler and Johnson of the B16 Air Force are sent to carry out the mission.As a film, Warriors of Future is a triumphant opportunity both seized and missed all wrapped in a $450 million dollar bow.The CG action scenes, while not up to Hollywood standards, are impressive for a first attempt.
||First-time director Ng Yuen Fai, who previously worked as a special effects artist, uses a quick cut style that's thrilling in a blink-and-you'll-miss-it type way.
||Although it is not photorealistic, everything visually falls into place and it has a consistent anime look of its own.Unfortunately, Warriors of Future suffers from a severe lack of originality and thin plotting and characterizations in a script that's written around the action set pieces.
||The majority of the script's flaws could have been easily fixed by cutting out a shot or delaying certain information to create suspense, just Screenwriting 101 level stuff.
||All of which wouldn't have cost Mr.
||Koo an extra cent.The overall results are Yin and Yang.
||Audiences will scratch their heads going, "The CG is decent.
||If you got that right, why couldn't you script this story better? Isn't writing the easier thing out of the two?"Everything had traces from something we've seen before.
||I counted up to twenty sci-fi films that Warriors of Future was pulling ideas from, including Avatar, Iron Man, District 9, GI Joe: The Rise of Cobra and even the Batman Arkham games.
||It'd make one killer drinking game.In the acting department, Sean Lau and Phillip Keung come out as the MVPs, breathing sweet life into the otherwise empty CG environments and helping Louis Koo carry the film in front of the camera.
||The buddy dynamic between the trio works well.Nick Cheung gives a stilted, steely-eyed "smell the fart" performance that's straight out of a Saturday morning cartoon.
||Carina Lau and Tse Kwan Ho are both underused, the former having to deliver exposition and the other in a taciturn role.That all said and done, Warriors of Future was a good time.
||Admittedly, I am biased being from Hong Kong.Louis Koo's dream of stimulating the Hong Kong film industry is a noble and, some might say, romantic notion.
||Koo has invested so much of his own money into this small island in China to build up its entertainment industry, sometimes making risky business decisions.
||For example, Koo deliberately chose to do all the visual effects in one company in Hong Kong.
||Normally, they are done by multiple companies across the globe for efficiency.That sentiment has touched people.
||Ever since it was reported that the film had a disappointing box office in Mainland China, Hong Kong audiences have actively gone out to support the film.
||It was packed for a weekday screening in my theater.Warriors of Future ended up being more than a one-off theatrical experience, but an actual showreel of future CGI-driven Hong Kong films to come.
||Computer effects aside, seeing Hong Kong actors in mech suits battling robots was an eye-opening spectacle in itself.
||Finally, when the credits rolled, everybody intuitively stayed in their seats and waited for the mid-credits scene like a Marvel movie.
||It all felt very communal.So from these sentiments alone, Hong Kong audiences will get more out of Warrior of Future.
||Honestly, I too am moved by Louis Koo's vision and even as I'm cracking jokes here, I don't feel like punching down on this film.
||It has my respect for its ambitions and it'll probably be remembered as the pioneer film.
||However, the film will struggle to impress an international audience as English-speaking audiences won't be as forgiving with its script and matter-of-factly written subtitles.
||The grammarian in me still eagerly wants to add a "the" to the title.If there is going to be a sequel to Warriors of Future, more effort needs to be devoted into the writing and storytelling.
||Local audiences won't be so forgiving the second time around.With my palms together into a prayer pose and sending positive vibes, I eagerly await the sequel.

CGIFestival (5/10)
||No real story, you just get some fight with robots and aliens just to save the already destroyed earth.
||The camera was moved sometimes so fast you couldn't really feel and see the set.
||The movie shows you humans, fighting, some cliches and that's it.
||It's a waste of time.
||I watched it in English.
||It was horrible.
||You wont remember a thing in a few hours.
||The characters are not well written.
||I have the feeling that they wanted to copy some crappy western style alien fighting movies, and they copied the bad dialogues and characters auswelle.
||All in all it's a 5.
||You can watch it, or leave it in the background but for that purpose you should just put some nice music on.

WarriorsofFuture (2/10)
||A for effort? Unfortunately effort doesn't do much in this day and age.
||The all-star veteran cast plays a set of extremely stereotypical characters that are easily forgotten.
||The dialogues are bland, the action scenes are unmemorable, and there seems to be very few logic behind the settings.
||The inclusion of the little girl is so painfully stereotypical of such Cantonese films that you feel like you are transported back to the 80s.
||If this movie is supposed to be Louis Koo's love letter to sci-fi films, its a commendable job as it offers so little in terms of modern sci-fi.
||And if this movie is supposed to represent Hong Kong's movie industry in the new age, that would be pretty tragic.

||Overall production is great, the story makes relative sense, the characters have some depth to them, the CGI is outstanding.
||I personally love the overall aesthetic of the movie.
||Cool suits, freaky aliens, everything an FPS gamer could ever dream of.
||The biggest problem for me is the pacing is just too fast.
||I can't appreciate the beautiful scenes long enough, the action sequences are great but it's also ruined by the constant changes of the camera angle which then becomes unwatchable.
||I was so hyped for this movie, but sadly it's a disappointment that could've been easily fixed with a better director.

||The story is nothing new.
||Humanity has screwed up the planet, alien thing has landed, robots, guns, explosions.
||Huzzah!The writing overall is pretty weak.
||There's some great scenes between the characters, and a lot of the banter is fun.
||But the movie is pretty predictable.
||You know who the bad guy is, who's going to live or die, and what all the major plot beats will be right from the start.
||The movie doesn't do anything new.That said, what is does, it does in style.
||The special effects are insanely good.
||This is the sort of thing that easily gives big Hollywood movies a run for their money.
||And the action is amazing.
||The choreography is truly next level, with great editing.
||And the fights play out well (not the typical Hollywood barrage of a thousand jump cuts).Grab some popcorn and enjoy a good mindless action filled romp.

Reallybad (3/10)
||I very much enjoy Chinese films and I hardly begrudge them pursuing the occasional formulaic Western-like action film.
||Unfortunately though, Warriors of the Future takes every soulless trope that Hollywood has to offer and amplifies it with genuinely dreadful execution.The story is shallow and nothing that we haven't seen a million times over.
||The characters are hackneyed, hyperbolic and frankly goofy.
||The script is sophomoric and cringe-inducing.
||The acting is so bad, so robotic, that it's almost funny at times.
||The direction and editing are lazy and uninspired.
||The audio is regularly out of sync.
||The list goes on and on.There are redeeming qualities in some of the CGI, moments in the photography and a few action sequences, but nowhere near enough to warrant watching this hot mess.
||I strongly encourage you to do something else with your time.

||A couple of things make this movie at best "watching with friend at home" ...The plot, very Basic and ilogical.The bomb that with all that technology, they couldn't make it a bit more specific with the blast radius.The typical girlfriend in anime that mean or says something like " come back, you haven't fixed my watch yet".The scene where they chat with the villain and not broadcast that is by far the dumbest thing in this movie.The ending ...
||was comedic.
||No guards near the most important section of the creature.
||Yes.The special effects were good, but that's about it.The emotional scenes felt very cheap.I saw someone comparing it with the Tomorrow War, no chance.
||Besides some exoschelets , no similarity.

||Louis Koo got into yet another bad Netflix flick following the Dynasty Warriors disaster.
||The future of HK film industry looks grim, considering there were 4 stars in the movie this time.They got Nick Cheung playing some old timer when he still sounds like a young man, and all he does in this role is making a "stone" face which actually looked more like he had plastic surgery and couldn't move it.
||Carina Lau sounded like she was directly reading off a script.
||Louis Koo and Sean Lau make some out-of-place banter in an attempt to make it a decent experience.
||In fact, pretty much the whole film consists of that.The lines and story were both horrible.
||Let's start with the plot elements that make 0 sense.
||This film tried to rip off starship troopers, but even starship troopers at least tried to logic.
||In this film, there are bugs that randomly nest in some alien plant that converts the air to their liking, but there's no sign of intelligence in these bugs at all, and too much of a stretch to believe that they're capable of hurling asteroids into planets.
||This asteroid hit this sector months ago, and there's 160m or some ppl living here right next to these plants...?One of the troops entered fight-or-fright mode and went with running away, but he was obviously still in control enough to try to put obstructions in the way and even lock himself in a container.
||If you still had your wits about you in the first place, you would have fired instead of just running.The film tried to mimic Iron Man, but the characters would periodically unmask themselves for absolutely no reason, and there were also some $%^& transformer moments.
||A man in full gear was supported by a metal pipe with no problems, but somehow some rebar sticking out of concrete gave way when he tried to hold onto that.The military team found out who sabotaged them, but decided to contact THAT guy instead of their command, which would have taken care of him.
||Likewise, once their military ally found out, instead of going to arrest him and taking control, they decide to just confront him by themselves, LOL.The film is also full of useless dialogue and drama.
||Some guy claims he's not going to let the team take a risky operation, and then somehow the dialogue shifts to how the leadership doesn't think he's should be leading the operation, and then, of course, they're in the operation...
||Everyone keeps asking Nick Cheung if he thought he could get away.
||He's sat in the room the whole time and has no thought of running away, so wtf? There's plenty more, but I'm not gonna list them all.So, to summarize: bad story, poor plot, no logic, unmemorable characters, fancy Transformers action scenes, STARS.

It'sok (5/10)
||It's ok, it had some good moments, some boring moments; there are some scenes I just did not understand at all for one reason or the other as they made no sense.
||Without giving any spoilers, I'll leave it up to you, but it just made no common sense for some to be...where no kids should be..
||All 3 female actresses were not very good and may be it wasn't their fault but the fault of the directors and the bad script
The story is very cheesey.
||I don't believe actors were right for this one, it just felt a bit amateurish and cheesy.Script had a lot of holes.I get it, it's a Sci-fi, but it should also make at least some basic common sense, and a lot of things did not throughout the whole movie.5.2/10.
||Anyone giving it more than a 6 is probably involved in the movie...
||There are a lot better movies from China and this is not one of them.

||Will they ever learn?This is NOT how we wanna watch these people speak, walk, behave or wave their arms around.
||Relax a bit, stop being stiff for a while, don't talk like you're addressing a nation every time you open your mouth.
||FFS, Koreans yell all the time, Japanese squeak all their lines, Chinese talk like their life depended on it.
||Rest your muscles, relax your vocal cords, ease the F down! Your movies will be THAT much easier to swallow (no pun intended).
||And don't overcompensate with redundant CGI.
||Movies are not all about blowing up stuff with questionable SFX.
||You can do better (and you sure did numerous times), why produce nonsense SF crap like Skyline.
||Westerners can do it themselves, do not add up.I am literally desperate for a quality Asian SF, with all the values and new angles.

Adecentonetimewatch (7/10)
||The story is basically bits and pieces of many other better movies in this genre, with added unnecessary melodramatics.
||That's not to say it isn't worth a watch, because there are many awesome action and fight scenes, and although a little sloppy at first, the visual effects do get better and are actually impressive for a non-Hollywood production.
||The story is extremely cliched and predictable, so don't expect anything revolutionary here, and you'll notice some plot and technical issues.
||It's like each of the three writers picked their favorite Hollywood film in this genre and mashed it all together.
||The editing could've been better, and the directing had many typical rookie mistakes.
||The pacing was spot-on, as was the score.
||The casting and performances are decent for the most part, cheesy dialogue aside.
||If you're a fan of this genre and have nothing better to watch, you'll enjoy this one.

Honestlygreattrybutverymuchflawed. (4/10)
||First thing: it is a must-watch for every Hongkonger and Hongkongese culture lover.
||The visual effects are enjoyable and the cast consists of popular celebrities (but repeating and a bit "too many grandpas").
||Stories are poorly written; plots are embarrassingly lazy; character developments are blank; dialogues are awkward.
||They really should have worked much harder.
||But, Hongkongers and the city's culture lovers are recommended to spend one and a half hours to (at least try to) enjoy Hong Kong's very first visual-minded science fiction movie in recent years.
||It is far from perfect and I can't deny it.
||But it is important to let film producers know their efforts are appreciated and many in the city are willing to give them another chance.

Turnoffyourbrainandyouwillenjoyit! (6/10)
||Warriors of Future is a Hong Kong sci-fi film, released on Netflix.
||The story is very simple (don't except any depth or Oscar acting) as it relies on the CGI.There are armour suits that look like Iron Man, various battle scenes with a giant plant, some zombie insects, and a few random robots.In terms of CGI, it is quite impressive.
||The actions are pretty quick.
||Overall, it has all the elements of a sci-fi genre film with a bit of emotion here & there.Towards the end, there is some massive struggle on a highway where robots are chasing down our heroes and it is really thrilling.Overall It is a decent film for a one-time watch, if you are a fan of SCI-FI.

Iamveryimpressed (7/10)
||Normally Chinese movies CGI is terrible as if watching a hollywood B lister or C lister movie quality BUT this movie right here wow the CGI was off the charts! I watched chinese movies growing up n this has to be the best CGI i seen in a chinese movie Ever!Though some negatives to this movie is not enough backstory go the characters as normally this is common theme plaguing the Hongkong/China movie industry.
||They often rush for action n visual effects to capture audiences fast but they fail always too understand that the plot story n character interactions is just as important.The Robots used in this film was amazing quality, I mean i was soo blown away and this movie might just be the stepping point for Chinese CGI to blossom from and beyond and too finally move towards improving to follow Hollywood slowly behind.Some Fight scenes the camera pans to fast n it often makes it hard to tell whats happening but alot of other scenes are quite visible clearly.Overall I am excited too see this vast improvement in Quality of visuals from a Chinese film and i look forward too seeing more to come in the future.

CGIfestwithaterriblescript (7/10)
||My rating logic: "10" for CGI, "4" for the script.
||(10+4)/2= "7"I've been on to this before it hit Netflix.
||After seeing it, I felt frustrated by the script.
||They could've fleshed out the story if they cut the VO in the beginning and add 20 mins of ground laying and threat intro.
||I saw the 2 deleted scenes from One Cool Film YouTube channel before watching the film.
||I preferred those 2 scenes over the VO.
||It makes more narrative sense.
||Now it feels like I'm only watching only Act 2 & 3 of the film.
||Because of that, the emotional scenes and sense of urgency all fell flat.
||There were times I felt like I should feel be sad, worried, or a feel a certain way, but I just can't because I don't know these characters.
||Mind you, Act 1 is just a VO.
||The only one whom the audience knows more about was Louis Koo's Tyler, but that he couldn't shine because the time was ticking.
||In short, they handle the characters and stakes like how they did in Morbius: the story fell flat because the creators cheaped out on Act 1.
||Then, everything came after that missed.I heard this version was cut down to pass China government's film board and to preserve the fast pace action-flick momentum.
||So, I really do hope One Cool Film will release a director's cut because the 2 deleted scenes (slow-paced and ground laying) was excellent.
||I want to see these slow-pace scenes in the movie!The deleted scenes (sorry, can't post the links)1) Soldiers badged into a fenced community, went up a steel ladder.
||In a dry and dusty apt, a dehydrated youth was building a model-size Xmas tree from metal scraps.
||The youth (turn out wearing a leg brace on one leg) ran out with large empty containers after hearing water announcement.
||The mass gathered.
||Rationed water was given through coordinated rainfall.
||The meteor hit.
||Giants vines grew, wreaking the the buildings and fenced community.2) The professor blankly stared out the window of the helicopter seeing the buildings and skynets.
||"Mankind is really absurd.
||Since the Industrial Revolution, mankind used 200 years to get the Earth sick.
||Then, mankind wanted to use 10 or more years to cure it.
||In the end, nothing was solved.
||We only ended up making dozens of fishbowls to trap ourselves inside." The professor leaned closer to the window.
||"I think Pandora is God's gift to us.
||A chance for mankind."Scene closes up in the female commander.
||"The only thing I believe is that I believe in nothing.
||My responsibility is to ensure that no matter what the circumstances are, there's always plan B." The music starts rolling.The professor turned to the female commander, looking concern.
||"What's plan B?" The female commander looked back at him.
||Scene cut to helicopters flying into B-16 area, probably heading to the base.Good things:CGI was excellent! Couldn't believe something like this was done by a Hong Kong production company.
||It's a great CGI portfolio.
||I want to see them participating in making Gundam or similar franchises.
||Hey, Hollywood maybe you can hire them to do your CGIs.

UnexpectedlytheworstVillainSci-fiever (3/10)
||I was expecting the movie to be great since Louis Koo, Ching Wang Lau, and Carina Lau were the main role in the movie.However, the appearance of those big HK stars weren't for the best.
||The plot sucks.
||How could you let the main culprit in the action to still act on his own will? Someone should have tried beating him or at least let him to be out of control of anything right?And then, some classic tense moments with the evil monsters were too dull, lacking of emphasize & details on certain action.
||Especially the one in the end.
||Carina Lau is either shot dead by the main antagonist or either the other way around.
||If feels like there are lots of missing important details which really deteriorate the overall excitement and general logic of the movie.In the middle part, as they successfully escaped from almost becoming the part of the "sandwich" in that huge collapsing building, they didn't even coughed a bit after such a massive amount of dust? Wtf? Also, Ching Wan Lau didn't try to escape or at least dodge or observe from far after he attempted to throw the liquid bomb? That blue gas didn't even make him faint? Oh boy....PS: When Louis Koo fought with the robot on the climax action part near the end of the movie, it looked stupid that he's been fighting for decades with that robot and in the end he just took that car's door and chop it to the robot's head.
||I was like, why didn't he goddamn do that earlier? What a lame action.I love HK movies and those great actors, I love Sci-fi, but can't relate to this one.

||This is officially the worse movie I've seen in my entire life, I am really disappointed.
||I can't believe I wasted 1hr40mins of my life.
||Such a shame that Netflix allowed this movie to on their home page.

||This movie is for those looking for adrenaline-pumping action with futuristic touches.
||It has a fairly simple plot that isn't really relevant, it's just an excuse for the display of visual effects that come by the ton.
||It is formulaic, hasty, sometimes emotional without any sense.
||By all accounts, it is a spectacle for the eyes, rather than for the brain.The performances are so-so, the effects are good on machinery, but bad on natural elements such as fire and the flow of movement of living beings, including the characters.
||In short, there are many reprehensible details, but exposing them would be superfluous, since it is not a film made to be perfect.
||It is mere entertainment.The American film The Tomorrow War is a good parallel.

||Guess you don't have to try when the government tells you what to watch.I can't recommend wasting time on this unless you want to see Netflix and it's desperation to get more subscribers from China.This movie is all about flashing lights and gun battles.

||He and Sean Lau led the movie and they showed a lot of comradery and chemistry.The action sequence and CGI are very good, though not at Hollywood standard.
||The fun part is the robot fighting the protagonists - reminiscent of some kung fu action.
||Character development was a little weak, but the action sequence compensated for it.

||Hard to believe it is the best box office movie in HK so far.
||It seems HK movie is a dead end!The story plot and all acting suck! The dialogue is corny and old-fashion like 'skynet' is me, I am the 'skynet'; the sky could be dark but we couldn't! OMG, what happened to the writers? Are all living in Paleolithic age? When even comparing to all those old HK movies like 'A better Tomorrow', the script looks more trendy than this one.The CGI isn't impressive and the color is dull.
||Hard to believe it spends over hundred million for this.
||It's hard to compare to Hollywood ones, even looks worsen than China movie like 'A Writer Odyssey'.Last but not least, all actors are supposed to be best ones who won several awards in the different film festival.
||But look at Nick Cheung's 'Botox face' in the play, I can't keep laughing all the way! Sean Lau's acting remains stereotyped and repetitive no matter what role he plays, same tone, same pace!
