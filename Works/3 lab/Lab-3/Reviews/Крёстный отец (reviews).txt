ThePinnacleOfFlawlessFilms! (not rated/10)
||'The Godfather' is the pinnacle of flawless films! The first time I viewed 'The Godfather' I was in my early teens and it was the most astounding film I had ever seen, and has since then stood as my all-time favourite film.
||It is due to this that I have been looking forward to writing a review of this unforgettable classic.
||So let's start from the beginning.
||The film opens to four words, 'I believe in America', it's crazy to think that this simple line has become a resonant quote solely due to the impact it made on the entrance to the film's "threshold".
||This is just one of the many renowned quotes that litter the film, and believe me, there are a lot.
||After the first take we are then absorbed into the life of Vito Corleone, brilliantly portrayed by the Oscar- winning performance of Marlon Brando.
||Vito is a feared man, he is a criminal, he is a mafioso, but above all he is a respected family man, his three sons are depicted by three excellent actors, James Caan, John Cazale and Al Pacino as well as his adopted child Tom Hagen, played by Robert Duvall.
||The film follows Vito as he attempts to transfer his crime empire to his reluctant son, Michael.
||With some of the most graphic and gruesome death scenes to have ever been seen in the 1970's film industry (including a certain horse's head), 'The Godfather' epitomises how violence can be used effectively within a film.
||The Corleone's are some of the greatest antiheroes to have ever been seen on screen, whilst they are villains, the audience will refuse to accept that fact, Coppola does something simple and audacious, he takes the guilt out of organised crime.
||A film rife with beautiful cinematography, memorable musical scores and well-paced action and drama.
||Overall, The Godfather is one of Hollywood's greatest critical and commercial successes that gets everything right; a gangster flick that is overflowing with life, rich with emotion and subtle acting, and further blessed with amazing direction from Francis Ford Coppola.
||Arguably the most unforgettable masterpiece to have ever been made.

Anoffersogood,Icouldn'trefuse (10/10)
||It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola's "The Godfather".
||I should probably go to bed.
||It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early.
||But not early enough to postpone writing these lines.
||Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on.
||So, bear with me.This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it.
||Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals.
||It is also the reason why it's so welcoming.
||We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men.
||And I do mean men.
||From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions.But it goes even deeper than that.
||It all revolves around the Corleone family led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando).
||He is the most honest of these men, sitting right on the edge.
||But for people like him, who do not fully embrace this world, it's not easy.
||He avoids conflict until it is absolutely necessary.
||He is a man defined by moral principles.
||There is a scene at the beginning, in which, during his daughter's wedding day, one of his associates, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) practices his speech that he is going to give to the Don when he meets him.
||The scene with these two is funny and almost adorable.
||I could not help but sympathize both of them only to realize that I am feeling warmth for two mobsters.
||Not to even mention that Lenny Montana was an actual mob hit-man and that he was actually nervous as he said that line.The more I watched the more I realized just how incredibly complex and ruthless this society is and how it has the power to corrupt anyone to come in contact with it.
||The best example is Corleone's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino).
||He returns home for his sister's wedding as a war hero dressed the part with his long-time girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton).
||At first, he avoids this underworld, but necessity, first-hand exposure and just its sheer devilish appealing nature draws him in.
||As we get further in the film, the change is shocking and every outsider who ever got close to him is tainted in one way or another.
||If they survive it, they are drawn in as well as we are as viewers.Inside, Coppola exposes the family to us fully, with a bold personal approach and we witness every discussion, every methodically calculated choice.
||Crime is done simply because it is the nature of their business, and we are put on a chair alongside them, so we easily relate.
||For us, they are the good guys, the rival families are the bad guys.
||This is the greatest feat this film managed to pull off--set apart good guys and bad guys in a world filled with bad guys.This is a film of unmatched subtlety.
||No other movie sustains itself as good.
||No other film is done with such precision, attention and completeness.
||There are many layers which I probably missed and maybe will never notice.
||But I felt them.
||What director Francis Ford Coppola and his partner in crime (poor choice of words, sorry) Mario Puzo did is nothing short of a timeless piece of reference cinema whose influence is not based on reinventing the wheel, but rather perfecting it to the absolute maximum.Most masterpieces are remembered for their historical contributions.
||"Citizen Kane" brought the biggest step-up to the art form, the same things did "Gone With the Wind" or "2001: A Space Odyssey".
||"The Godfather" is one of the few films that will be remembered simply because they are that good and I cannot possibly imagine a greater achievement.

AnIconicFilm (10/10)
||Tell me a movie that is more famous than this.
||Tell me a movie that has had more parodies spinned off its storyline than this.
||Tell me one movie that has been as quoted as a much as this.
||The answer is you can't.
||No movie has had as much of an impact as The Godfather has had ever since it was released.The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say.
||What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall.
||This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies.
||With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight.
||His performance as the godfather alone is iconic.
||His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché.
||His performance though was not a cliché.
||His performance was subtle and breathtaking.
||It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself.
||Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well.
||What a way to start up your career.
||His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly.
||He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies.
||His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me.
||Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie.
||He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia.
||His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;.
||This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout.
||The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking.
||As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this.
||It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect.
||It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene.
||There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get.The directing by Coppola was perfect as well.
||Not many movies can be 3 hours and yet maintain a good level of interest from the audience like The Godfather.
||Coppola deserves credit for this.
||The symbolism and messages that went into every scene also has to do with the directing not just the writing.
||The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection.The cinematography and music were perfect.
||The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever.
||If you were to hear it you could identify it right away.
||The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie.
||The Godfather seems to have this mystique to it, it gives you the feeling you are watching something truly remarkable.The horse's head, the scene of Brando running with his groceries, the coffee shop scene, "I'll give him an offer he can't refuse" and countless other scenes and quotes from this movie have become a part of our culture.
||These scenes and lines have been recycled over and over again in comedies, commercials, etc.
||that it is impossible to avoid the greatness of The Godfather.
||The Godfather is like a disease once you see it you fall in love with it.
||I don't know if it is the greatest movie ever but it is definitely the most iconic film ever made.

Anotherkindof"familymovie" (10/10)
||The Godfather is one of the few films in which I personally did not find any significant weakness even after many viewings.
||From the direction, to the acting, to the storyline, to the score, The Godfather has the word classic written all over, and it really is not much of a surprise that it is now considered by many one of the top five movies of all time.
||Perhaps when it comes to cinematic techniques The Godfather has not been as revolutionary as Citizen Kane, but its influence on motion pictures is comparable.
||Rarely a movie has defined or re-defined a genre as much as this one did for "gangster movies", but its influence goes well beyond that.The Godfather's influence has been so big through the years that elements of it can be found in virtually every "organized crime film" nowadays; almost every comedy featuring a gangster in the last few years has spoofed something in The Godfather.
||The Italian-American old mobster a-la Don Vito Corleone has become one of the most established figures in the public's imagination.But to say that The Godfather is simply "influential" is to diminish its true qualities, and so is to describe it simply as "a movie about gangsters".
||The Mafia is certainly the main focus the story revolves around (despite the fact that the word is never mentioned), but although the movie never tries to forcedly insert separate subjects it contains an amount of psychological and social subtexts that cannot be overlooked.
||Considerations on how the social environments changes us, on how moral values appear different from different point of views, on how violence can destroy a human soul, and on how power can corrupt an individual are deeply blended into a story that stays practically always true to complete realism, and the result is a picture of astonishing efficacy and believability.As good as the direction and the story are, it would be unfair not to consider the major role that the actors' performances had in the cinematic triumph that was The Godfather.
||Praised by many as the best cast to ever appear in an American movie, all the cast in The Godfather succeeds in portraying complex, three-dimensional characters without ever making a slip.
||The exceptional portrayals of Don Vito and Michael Corleone respectively by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, the performances by Robert Duvall, James Caan and Diane Keaton as Tom Hagen, Santino Corleone and Kay Adams, the ruthless Virgil Sollozzo played by Al Lettieri -- as well as more than a few other roles -- are all perfect for the movie, and they all succeed in making us believe these are real people, not just actors.
||We are not watching a central character and a bunch of incomplete figures that revolve around him: although Michael Corleone is the character that gets the most screen time, everybody is the center of this world his own way.
||The movie makes it possible for the viewers to identify with different characters and to observe how their personality and story fits in, and it does it much more effectively than many bloated multiple-storyline movies that came out in the last few years.The movie opens on the wedding of Don Vito Corleone's daughter, Connie (Talia Shire).
||Don Corleone is a powerful man, and it was not without the use of violence that he achieved this position during the course of his life.
||The wedding scene gives a perfect setting of where and how the Don's power extends; from the regular worker in a neighborhood, to the immensely popular singer, to the friends in politics and right to the ruthless killer, Don Corleone has links to people ready to ask him favors and to pay him back.
||Some are trustworthy, some are not, but thanks to his intelligence and intuit the Don can almost always distinguish the two.However, this is 1946, times are changing, and to many of the younger people working in the crime business, Don Corleone's ideas are becoming obsolete.
||The Don believes that the new trend in the business, narcotics, is too dangerous and the families dealing with it would eventually end up self-destroying; while his family had deals in alcohol and gambling for a long time, part of the Government and law enforcement was ready to close one eye.
||Drugs are another thing.To this day, Don Corleone was able to keep things together while maintaining his economic and political power, but things will brutally change when a powerful drug dealer name Sollozzo enters the picture.
||The refusal of Don Corleone to cooperate with Sollozzo, and a weakness immediately spotted by the latter, will ignite a war that will cost many lives, and that will see Michael Corleone, Vito's younger son and the one who never wanted to take part in the family business, lose his "innocence" and transform into a gangster as ruthless as the people he initially stood up against.I purposely decided not to spoil much about the plot because I believe that the film is perfectly enjoyed without knowing anything in advance, and -- believe it or not -- there are still quite a lot of people who have never seen this movie.
||There are multiple scenes that manage to create an incredible tension, various twists, and although like any other masterpiece The Godfather can be watched knowing the whole story beforehand and still be a phenomenal experience, I believe it is always a pleasure to see it for the first time and enjoy its multiple climaxes.
||Besides, to outline such complicated characters and such an emotionally intense story in a short review like this one would be inadmissible.There has been much speculation on how the events in The Godfather novel written by Mario Puzo, the book the film is based on, could be an exposé of true facts.
||Many believe that the character of Johnny Fontane , for instance, was based on Frank Sinatra's real life, and many of the other characters were modeled after real people.
||I won't go into that: frankly, I have no idea whether these voices are reliable, although the Frank Sinatra reference seems obviously quite believable.The cinematography of The Godfather is dark and tasteful, and colors are used perfectly to give a true feel of the era it is set in.
||There is a fair amount of violence, though rarely gratuitous.The Godfather certainly doesn't need my recommendation.
||The film is universally considered one of the best of all time, and the performances by Pacino and Brando alone is the stuff of legends.

Oneofthebestofalltime. (10/10)
||A masterclass in film making, is The Godfather a contender for the best film of all time? I'd argue the case that it is, this is the ultimate gangster movie.Before you panic at the thought of a film being almost three hours long, you needn't, you won't even notice the time, it flies by.Production values are incredible, it looks sublime the whole way through, it's so well produced, at roughly fifty years old it puts many new films to shame.Brandon, Pacino and Castellano, just a few of the Incredible performances, I could add a whole lot more.If you're considering buying a hard copy, I would recommend it on blu ray, it is sharper than the dvd, there is a difference.This film has had a huge influence down the years, it is still, and will forever be, one of the greatest, 10/10.

#2onIMDb'sTop100,amulti-Oscar-winnerandover1500reviews...whatmorecanIsayaboutthemovie?! (10/10)
||Up until today, I haven't bothered to review "The Godfather".
||After all, everyone pretty much knows it's one of the greatest films ever made.
||It's #2 on IMDb's Top 100.
||It won the Best Picture Oscar.
||And, there are nearly 1600 reviews on IMDb.
||So what's one more review?! Well, after completing 14,000 reviews (because I am nuts), I guess it's time I got around to reviewing a film I should have reviewed a long time ago.
||So, here goes....the film is perfect and only a dope wouldn't watch it.
||Unfortunately, IMDb requires me to say more to meet it's 10 line minimum for reviews.
||So, I'll point out that you do NOT need to like gangster films to enjoy this film.
||Yes, it's violent and nasty in spots--but it's also brilliantly written and produced from start to finish and deserves the accolades it's received.My advice is that instead of just watching "The Godfather" and "The Godfather: Part II", see the combined version they created for television--with additional scenes that made it a very rich experience.

I'mfindingithardtodescribehowamazingthismoviewas (10/10)
||There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, that have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well.
||I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing.
||There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago.
||The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now.True, The Godfather is a little slow-moving and the plot takes a while to unfold, but neither of these are flaws as such.
||The slow pacing added to the elegiac quality The Godfather has, and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you.
||Being 18, I was worried whether I was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it, but luckily I understood it perfectly, and I can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to be.The Godfather for one thing looks stunning.
||I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film.
||In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque.
||It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate.Then there is the score by Nina Rota.
||One word, outstanding! I have heard many wonderful scores in my lifetime, but after hearing this score few stick in the memory as much as the score for The Godfather.
||This score is both beautiful as seen with the main theme, and haunting in the way it sticks in your head after watching the film itself.
||Other outstanding assets are the masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola, and the brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent, thought-provoking and darkly humorous.
||As for the violence, some of it is shocking and intense especially in the climax which was enough to almost make your heart either beat twice as fast or stop, and I almost covered my eyes when the producer found the horse's head in his bed, but underneath that this family is somewhat loyal and honourable come to think of it.The acting is absolutely fantastic, bringing to life characters that are rich and complex, perhaps unlikeable at first but as you get to know them you warm to them.
||And I have to say, The Godfather is one of those rarities where no actor gives a weak performance.
||In particular, Marlon Brando is brilliant as Don Vito, very heavily disguised yet stately.
||Every word of dialogue, every subtle hand gesture and every facial expression was brilliantly judged.
||Al Pacino's casting was admittedly risky, but he still did a truly wonderful job carrying the film, while James Caan is dignified and loyal, Diane Keaton beautiful and alluring and Robert Duvall nicely understated.In conclusion, absolutely amazing, and I can see completely why it is considered one of the 10 greatest movies ever made, it is that good.
||In fact my 15-year old brother loved it so much, he wants to see it again.
||10/10, though this film is too good for that rating.

Initially,Iwasn'tafan...butthenIrealised (10/10)
||This is a masterpiece.
||A timeless masterpiece.
||Initially, I didn't like this film all that much - I found it rather over-hyped and boring.
||This was until the advent of DVD, which gave me the feature I needed for this sort of film: subtitles.
||Once I switched them on and heard (read) every last word of Brando's ramblings and other characters ramblings, I grew a true appreciation for this epic.To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony.
||For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same.Of course, there are exceptions to rule (ie...
||where you want mono-tonal characters...
||aka matrix; or where you want outlandish contrasts...
||aka The Fifth Element), but ultimately, this is what makes films deep, meaningful and grand.
||Consider the contrasts between the Don's children.
||Michael is rather cool, rational and collected, whereas Sonny is more hot-headed, spontaneous and simple minded.
||But simply having these contrasts is not nearly enough.
||What you really need to do is to develop these characters - place them in situations - and then dwell on how their character impacts on the situation they're put in.
||The Godfather is a terrific example of how to pull this off.
||While many try to do this in screenplays, most lose the plot and create character obscurities that stretch credibility.2) Transformation: The central character(s) must undergo a transformation, resulting in them being almost unrecognizable by the end of the film.
||By putting them into situations, the character's character must not only influence the outcome of the situation; it must also have a lasting impact on the character.
||Consider Michael at the wedding and compare that to the Michael we see at the end of the film.
||Again, many films try, but most fail because they come up with unreal (literally, not praisingly) or simply moronic transformations (eg, Wall Street).3) Patience: Men in Black 2 was an astounding film for one simple reason - it was an entire film squashed into about 70 minutes.
||It was not much longer than an episode of ER or Buffy.
||I certainly hope the new goal of Hollywood isn't to make films as short as possible.All the great ones spend time - time developing characters, family life, growth, patience with the story telling in general.
||This is the key (provided that the story isn't mind-numbingly boring).
||Dances with Wolves, Heat..
||and so on are very patient but top-class films.
||While studios may be lukewarm on the idea of longer films, they are worth it if you have a ripper story to base it on.I feel that this film has not dated all that much and has tremendous re-watch-ability.

"TheGodfather"isprettymuchflawless,andoneofthegreatestfilmsevermade (10/10)
||Rather than concentrating on everything that is great about The Godfather, a much easier way for me to judge its quality is on what is bad about it.
||Almost every film has something that I don't like about it, but I can honestly say that I wouldn't change anything about The Godfather.
||There is nothing weak about it and nothing that stands out as bad.
||That's why it gets ten out of ten.This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier.
||The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons.
||The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it.
||The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic.The film is pretty shocking in the way every death occurs almost instantaneously, and as it spans ten years so many different things happen and every minute of it is great entertainment.
||It's a well-made and entertaining film that is only the first part of a trilogy, but it stands on its own as a wonderful film in its own right.
||If you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for? This was one acclaimed film that didn't disappoint.

AnEpic,MasterfulLookintotheUndergroundWorld (10/10)
||"The Godfather" simply put, is one of the greatest films of all time.
||The script is thee best I've ever read.
||The direction is flawless.
||The acting may very well have the best ensemble cast in any movie I've ever seen or will ever see.
||It's also one of the most precise and intricate films I've ever come across as writer, Mario Puzo brings out some of the most hidden and guarded secrets of the underground world ever captured on film.
||Watching "The Godfather," is like watching cinematic art.
||Francis Ford Coppola's direction is what brings this film, that's so ambitious and so grand, down to earth with precision direction as he handles each and every scene with such care.
||The film starts with a black screen and an opening monologue from an undertaker.
||As the man starts talking about honor, family, respect, and justice we are pulled right in on his luminous eyes as he stands in near darkness.
||He begs for justice since the American system has failed him.
||He goes to Don Corleone (Marlon Brando) for justice.
||Don Vito is the man of power.
||He's the one who pulls all the strings and watches his puppets dance from behind the stage and out of sight; untouchable, or so we think.
||Some of the greatest moments in the film- and very intentional to show the distinguishable difference between Michael and Vito- are of Vito crying over his son, Sonny's (James Caan), death.
||When Michael learns of the news, he has little reaction.
||Two of the most emotionally powerful scenes in the film are from the cause of a loved one that has died long before he should have, and they come from Brando.
||As Vito stands over the body of his son he nearly breaks down.
||There is clash of feelings between the two men that are never conflicting, but compared.
||The film opens during the wedding of Don Vito' daughter, Connie (Talia Shire), and we see just how strong the bond of family really is.
||You have the family dancing with each other, drinking, laughing, and sitting next to each other to show how close they are, then we see some of the outsiders such as the Barzini family, and surprisingly Michael (Al Pacino) along with his girlfriend Kay (Diane Keaton) on the outskirts without much interaction.
||Michael seems almost out of place as if he is the adopted son and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is more apart of the family than he is.
||His opening words are to Kay, and they include, "That's my family, Kay.
||That's not me." We get the feeling that Michael's nearly ashamed of the stigma that goes along with his last name: This is what makes Al Pacino' role- significantly- the hardest performance in the entire film to portray.
||He's the one doing all the heavy lifting as he has to go from outsider and completely against the family's actions and businesses to, by films end, head of the family.
||Brando has the teary eyed moments that actors live for, but Michael is too cold for that.
||Never for a second as he gradually comes to power do we think this turn is ridiculous or laughable, and in lesser hands it very easily could have been.
||The final act of the film is loaded with plot points as decisions are made left and right as the film becomes visually and emotionally captivating.
||As the film draws to an end, Michael has gained half of the power of the family and makes most of the decisions.
||He's treated, not with respect, but as an outsider, too high ranking for his experience.
||The Corleone family is on the brink of disaster and losing everything, yet we never get that feeling.
||We see the two leader's confidence and we keep our confidence in them, even if the other family members doubt their decisions.
||Michael goes to Las Vegas and makes Moe Greene an offer he can't refuse.
||Then he refuses.
||This is Pacino' shinning moment in the film.
||There's no screaming or the hoopla that goes along with his name.
||After he treats Moe Greene like utter garbage, Fredo (John Cazale) get's upset and starts barking at him.
||Coppola is perfectly on his game here, too, as we watch from Fredo's height, looking down on Michael who sits in a chair as he coldly looks up with his radiating eyes, that have so much going on behind them, and simply says, "Fredo, don't ever take sides with anyone against family again.
||Ever."That's some serious foreshadowing for the second film, and only after watching the second film can you go back and appreciate what Pacino and Coppola pulled off in this scene; Cazale too.
||We have no idea how serious Michael is.
||These are some of the stepping stones that make Michael's change believable.
||He's not quite his father- Vito has a soft spot for his children (admittedly so)- as he's capable of turning on anyone and using the line, "It's strictly business" when it comes to family issues.
||Michael's sister, Connie, calls him a "cold hearted bastard" at the end of the film.
||It's hard to find better superlatives than that, yet we still love him.
||The interesting thing about Pacino' performance is that he doesn't sugarcoat it.
||He doesn't try to make the audience love him.
||He plays the character as the character should be played.
||That's the sign of great writing; great acting; and great directing since we could have very easily seen someone try to make him likable.
||This crew just presents the character with all his flaws and let's us decide if we love him or hate him.
||Its films like "The Godfather," that made me wish I had amnesia, so I could feel the same heart pounding moments over and over again.

||I feel like I've missed something, like I definitely enjoyed the film but it was dragged out way longer then it should've.
||There was definitely a few pointless scenes.
||I can understand this was way ahead of its time but I'm obviously watching this 50 years late.
||Which is the reason I believe I didn't enjoy it as much as the rest of you.
||If you read the rest of my reviews of old film I actually really enjoyed them so don't blame it on my youth.
||I'll definitely watch the second one aswell at some point and I'm sure I'll really like that one but I've seen films I've given an 8 that are way better.
||Marlon won the Oscar for best leading role but I think he should've won best supporting role and Al pacino should've been put up for the Oscar.
||Marlon wasn't in the film nearly as much as I thought he'd be.
||All in all it definitely wasn't a bad film, in fact a good film but that's all just a good film.

||This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing.
|| It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well.
|| Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses.
|| Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life.
|| This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable.

Magnificentportraitoforganizedcrime (9/10)
||This is by far the best movie ever to give a portrait organized crime, this movie goes deep inside and shows it all inside out..With superb acting by especially Al Pacino as Mike Corleone and Marlon Brando as Don Vito corleone this movie shows how one of the head mafia families in New York works, it gives a detailed picture of how their business runs and what kinda chances they got to take on their business, for example their denial to step inside the narcotic business brings on alot of troubles, but also it shows what kinda sacrifices they make, every day could be their last day..Al Pacino shines above all in this movie, as the smart boy of the family he returns after fighting a war for his country, at that time not involved in the family business, but it doesn't take long before the war breaks lose and he see no other ways than to step in and fight for his family.This is definetely a "must see" masterpiece.

Everythingyou'veeverheardistrue... (10/10)
||THE GODFATHER is quite simply a masterful piece of film-making, an epic in the truest sense of the word and by far the finest gangster film ever shot.
||Made with finesse, style to spare and a director who elicits pitch-perfect performances from a talented cast, this is movie-making as it should be.Yes, it's a very long film and yes, some sections are quite slow.
||Nevertheless, none of the film is any less than riveting.
||The story - of a father/son takeover in one of New York's major Italian Mafia families - is fairly straight forward, and yet Francis Ford Coppola turns it into something else so much more; a meditation on the human condition, perhaps.Certainly this is a film that explores the darker side of humanity.
||Jealousy, betrayal, anger and revenge are all key themes here, and the film is inevitably punctuated by moments of graphic and shocking violence.
||And I'm glad Coppola chooses not to shy away from the said violence, which makes it all the more gritty and realistic when it does happen.Marlon Brando takes the showrunner role here, the patriarch who's past his prime, but it's easy to spot the real star of the piece: Al Pacino, who burns up the screen with sheer ferocity.
||Robert Duvall is easy to miss in a quieter part, but watch out for James Caan whose volatile Sonny is one of the film's most engaging characters.
||Altogether this is a splendid and unforgettable piece of film-making, which inevitably spawned sequels and a whole gamut of similar gangster fare, but THE GODFATHER towers head and shoulders above them all.

TheGeatestMovieEverMade (10/10)
||You can't really criticize a film like "The Godfather", especially from a younger-type guy like me.
||Since its release in 1972, "The Godfather" has been highly praised by fans universally.
||It's extremely hard for a person who has never seen "The Godfather" without having high expectations because millions of people, maybe more have been talking about how wonderful it is.
||But as a film critic who has seen the movie several times and has read the novel that it was based on by Mario Puzo, this movie really deserves the credibility it gets.
||It really is that special.
||The film is a gripping epic that indulges the viewer with plenty of unsuspecting twists and a plot that works in a multitude of dimensions.
||The mobster's depicted here face many trials and tribulation that involve marriage, favours, family struggles, turncoats, tragic events, violence and rigor mortis.Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head patriarch and kingpin of his esteemed enterprise is acquainted to at his daughter's wedding, which is a special occurrence in Italian tradition (Sicilian in particular) where the father of the bride is to refrain from offering the groom any special favours.
||His representatives showing their signs of respect towards the Don are featured in the opening scenes are told through their ways of personal address and greeting regimentations.
||The Don is to be treated with respect and dignity, a man who follows his own frame of mind to what is fair, and will likely deny any means of avenge.
||As an example, if anyone was to fondle with his daughter in any kind of way grounds for murder.
||It's not revenge, as long as your daughter's still breathing.There are also numerous facets that indicate how not so respected the Don really is.
||Vito comes from the old school of Mafia, and can be labeled as a "Moustache" Pete.
||For one, unlike his adversaries, he refuses to get involved with drugs or smuggling for that matter.
||It this is much to the chagrin of other rival mob units in the state of New York.
||The violence is described disturbingly as nothing personal, it's just business.
||The philosophy behind this organized crime is chilling, but quite convincing.
||The violence is creepily accepted and sometimes happens all of the sudden.
||Suddenly, the Corleone enterprise falls on its foundations, and it's up to the next generation to restore the family so it could be ranked as the top of the best mob families.The cast features a myriad of talented performers each playing their respective roles flawlessly.
||The top stars like Brando as Vito, James Caan as the hot-tempered Sonny, Al Pacino as the likable Michael, John Cazale as middle-sibling Fredo, Robert Duvall as mob attorney Tom Hagen, Richard Castellano as Clemenza, Abe Vigoda as Tessio and Diane Keaton as Kay Adams are what I may have expected what the characters from Puzo's book look like physically.
||Even the smaller roles deserve special credit.
||The performances were absolutely amazing.
||The characters in the film compliment the characters from the novel and it is mainly due to the physical structuring and the carefully planned interpretation.The novel this movie was based on by Mario Puzo deserves praise in itself.
||Even though this movie was a fictional, there are a lot of authentic features that make every scene and every chapter to be real.
||I guess people when they think of mob bosses they visualize a supreme Don, sitting in his chair with a long facial expression contemplating with endless level-headedness and leadership.
||"The Godfather" is a marvel from both the film and the novel and it is hard to determine what medium is the better of the two.If there is one thing that the book is better would be character development.
||Al Pacino's Michael Corleone is a more prominent character in the novel than in the movie.
||Michael's transformation in the movie is at times a bit rushed, while in the book it's handled more gradual.
||The other character Luca Brasi played by Lenny Montana was a more vital character in the novel, which while he was an ally to the Corleone clan, is marked as a threatening adversary with a dark and dreary secret.
||In the movie comes across as a big oaf, and not as scary.
||It's also nice that some of the smaller characters from the novel have engaging back stories like Captain McCluskey (Sterling Hayden).
||But that's good for the novel's sake, while the film would result in overdone detailing.Overall, "The Godfather" is one of the greatest films ever made.
||Thanks mainly to the crew for creating a well-structured setting that compliments nicely to the characters, the script and most importantly, the direction of Francis Ford Coppola.
||Hats off to the cinematography from Gordon Willis which is backed nicely by the elegant score from Nino Rota and Carlo Savina.
||This film truly defines the words "required viewings."

TheGodfathermakemeanofferthatIcannotrefuse.Thismovieisamasterpiece. (10/10)
||It's basically impossible to watch this movie directed by Francis Ford Coppola, without already knowing some of the major themes, motifs, plot twists, within author Mario Puzo's story; due to how popular the film is.
||Even, if you haven't saw the movie, you probably heard of it.
||If you had, saw it.
||You might agree with me, in scope, that this movie is indeed, one of the greatest films ever made.
||Based off, Mario Puzo's 1969 novel with the same name, The Godfather tells the story of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) on his journey, from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss, during the criminal drug wars of the 1940/early 1950s.
||Without spoiling the movie, too much, I found that a lot of critics, overpraise Marlon Brando's work in this, a way too much.
||Don't get me wrong, Marlon Brando does deserve, a lot of credit for making his character, the patriarch Vito Corleone, so iconic.
||I just don't believe, that he deserve, the Oscar for Best Actor, that year.
||In my opinion, Al Pacino should had be nominated & won.
||After all, Michael is pretty much, the main character, not Vito.
||Also, Pacino is the one actor that kept the movie, going, with his great range of emotional.
||Brando show-what disappears, toward the middle of the film.
||If any, Brando deserve to win, Best Supporting Actor at the Academy Awards, because Brando's acting is secondary to that of Pacino.
||It's not personality, it's only business.
||Besides that, the acting throughout the film was well-performed, from all the actors.
||I just wish, there wasn't much, many characters.
||It was so hard to keep track of each one.
||Some actors, worth noting for their performance are James Caan as Michael's hot-headed brother, Sonny Corleone, Robert Duvall as Irish lawyer, Tom Hagen, Diane Keaton as Michael's girlfriend, Kay Adams & last, John Cazale as Michael's weaker brother, Fredo Corleone.
||As much, as I despise, certain gangster films.
||There was something, likable with these characters.
||Yes, they do, horrible stuff, but you can't help, feeling bad for them.
||Indeed, keep your friends close, your enemies closer.
||Not only was the film had gifted actors, but it was very well-shot.
||I love, how the film used doors, as a way to symbolize, the different between family life, and 'the family life'.
||A great example of this, was the last few minutes of the film in which Kay finds out, the truth nature about Michael.
||It's a crucial theme of the film.
||The five families are essentially living the American dream with specific ideals that America at the time greatly treasured.
||One could easily see this as a deconstruction or even an attack on the idea of the American Dream.
||So it was no surprise that the families met inside a Federal Reserve Bank.
||Talk about smart! I also like, how the movie has this stark bleak look to it.
||All the colors in the film, looks so muted, as if to say, this gangster film was indeed shot in early 1940s, technicolor.
||I like how, clever, the filmmaker was, when using bright colors.
||Most of the only bright color, used in the film, was orange.
||It was used as mostly an item, like a fruit symbol.
||It representing sin, and greed.
||It's as if it was the forbidden fruit, in the bible.
||It was also, used as a sexual way to show impending judgment.
||Everybody that got near it, end up, dying in the film.
||While, the movie has tons of other symbolism.
||It's also shroud in darkness and mystery.
||The movie even has a few film noir inspire scenes, where shadow, become a big factor to show, how shady, the underworld, can be.
||Vito's daughter's wedding scene shows the best of this.
||The movie has a lot of violence as well.
||Scenes like the real horse severed head were pretty gruesome.
||Still, compare to modern day, gangster movies, the sex, drugs and violence is pretty tame.
||For the most part, the movie kept to a somewhat classy mode with its subject matter.
||I do like the editing.
||The whole baptize sequence was amazing to watch.
||The pacing for the film is a mixed bag for me.
||There were some parts of the film that I kinda found boring or out of place, such as the Sicily, Las Vegas & Hollywood scenes.
||It felt like, I was watching two different films, due to how unfamiliar, each of those scenes, were, when comparing to the New York settling.
||I just glad, they were very short.
||The film also drops a lot of the novel's subplots, such as Sonny's mistress, having a large vagina, and having to get surgery on it.
||Another thing worth cutting is a lot of Johnny Fontane (Al Martino) and Lucy Mancini (Jeannie Linero) scenes.
||In the novel they both get big story lines nearly the equal of the main storyline with Michael.
||I'm glad, they cut it out, because it was too jarring.
||Though one major one, they cut out in this film: Don Vito's youth and rise to power came back, as part of the sequel, 1974's the Godfather: Part II.
||Happy, that they found, a way to add that, back in.
||Leave the Fontane BS.
||Take the cannoli, instead.
||The film score by Nino Rota was great.
||You really think of the word 'mafia' when you hear that tune.
||While, the film doesn't deliberately speak that word, it did expose, what was then, a mostly hidden underworld of Mafia organizations.
||Overall: While, some big time criminals and even some stars, like Frank Sinatra were against it, and boycott the film, but they couldn't stop the movie, from being made.
||The Godfather continues to influence producers of films, television shows, and video games more than 40 years after its release.
||It's a classic.

Afilmofgreatpowerandamilestoneinthehistoryofthecinema (8/10)
||Before 'The Godfather' came out in 1972, the gangster genre, chiefly associated with Jimmy Cagney and the film noir style of the forties and fifties, had been in something of a decline.
||It was, therefore, a brave move for Francis Ford Coppola to attempt a three-hour epic based upon the family life of a Mafia don.
||The film opens in the immediate post-war period with the wedding of the daughter of Don Vito Corleone.
||Scenes of the wedding are intercut with scenes showing Don Vito himself in his study, granting favours and dispensing a crude form of justice as though he were an absolute monarch.
||We soon learn, however, that times are changing, even in the world of organised crime.
||Don Vito's empire has been based upon gambling, illicit liquor sales and prostitution.
||Other Mafia families, however, are eager for the profits to be made from drugs, and Corleone receives a proposal from a drug dealer named Sollozzo that the Corleone clan should join him in exploiting the narcotics market.
||Corleone refuses, ostensibly for business reasons, but it is made clear that his real objections to narcotics derive from his personal code of honour.
||Sollozzo, offended, orders an attempt to be made on Corleone's life.
||This fails, but Corleone is left seriously injured.The focus now shifts to the younger generation.
||Don Vito has three sons, Santino ('Sonny'), Fredo and Michael, and an adopted son, Tom Hagen.
||These four have contrasting characters.
||Sonny is hot-headed and impetuous, Fredo weak, Tom cautious and moderate.
||Michael, the youngest, loves his family, but initially wants to play no part in their criminal enterprises.
||Recently returned from the war, his ambitions are to qualify as a lawyer and to settle down in a respectable life with his Anglo-Saxon wife-to-be, Kay.
||The attempt on his father's life, however, persuades Michael that his first loyalty is to the family, and he agrees to be part of a revenge attack on Sollozzo and Captain McCluskey the corrupt policeman who is on his payroll.
||There follows a brutal cycle of revenge, as each killing is avenged by another murder.
||The film's emphasis on family ties, honour and vengeance recall the revengers' tragedies of the Shakespearean and Jacobean theatre.
||Coppola does seem to be aiming for a Shakespearean grandeur.
||Don Vito, the ageing monarch whose powers slip away is reminiscent of King Lear, Michael, a good man corrupted by power, of Macbeth (a comparison which will become even more apt in the later episodes of the trilogy).
||There is also something of Hamlet in Michael and Sonny's resolve to avenge their father.
||Such an ambitious film requires acting of a very high order if it is to seem credible, but Coppola was able to draw upon some of the best performances of the seventies.
||To my mind, this was Marlon Brando's last great role (I have never cared much for 'Apocalypse Now' and loathed 'Last Tango in Paris'), but it was one that he made the most of.
||His Don Vito is both terrifying and pitiable, part dictator and part lonely old man.
||His rasping voice (the result of an earlier bullet wound in the throat) conveys both menace and physical weakness.
||Don Vito may be a bad man, but he is also in a way a magnificent one, and his passing marks the end of an era.
||If the film was notable for the last of the great Brando, it also saw the birth of a new star.
||Except perhaps for 'The Godfather Part II', I have never seen Al Pacino give a better performance than he did here, as he portrayed Michael's passage from a 'civilian' (as his brother calls him) to a warlord, from an innocent young idealist to a ruthless killer.
||Given the length of time that Pacino is on screen, I am surprised that he was only nominated for Best Supporting Actor rather than Best Actor.
||It would be interesting to speculate who might have won if he and Brando had been in competition for the award.
||I am even more surprised that Pacino did not win as Best Supporting Actor; Joel Grey's role in 'Cabaret' (which did win) is more showy and a technical tour de force, but it lacks the emotional depth of Pacino's performance.
||I also greatly admired James Caan's role as the hot-headed Sonny.
||This is not a perfect film; it has flaws, both artistic and ethical.
||Artistically, there are places where it tends to drag, particularly after the killings of Sollozzo and McCluskey, and even more so after the killing of Sonny, although it recovers at the ending, which is a highly effective piece of cinema.
||Ethically, I felt that the film tended to take the characters' world view too much at face value.
||Don Vito may be a dictator, but he is in his own eyes a benevolent dictator, a man of honour who lives by his own moral code.
||As others such as Roger Ebert have pointed out, this is a film which views a closed society from the inside; the only outsider is Kay, and her role is a relatively minor one.
||As a result, we do not get to see the damage that organised crime does to the fabric of society, and the Mafia's own view of itself is never openly challenged.
||That is not to say, however, that the film is totally amoral.
||We do see that an ethos of taking revenge can spiral out of control and lead to unforeseen consequences, to the innocent as well as the guilty.
||This is particularly true of the scenes where Michael takes refuge in Sicily after killing Sollozzo.
||The dead man's associates track him down, and a bomb meant for him instead kills his innocent young Italian wife Apollonia.
||Although there may be no overt condemnation of the moral position of the Mafia, there is implied criticism of its bloodier deeds.
||All the characters, whatever the crimes of which they may be guilty, are careful to pay lip-service to the Catholic Church and its rituals.
||Throughout the film (indeed, throughout the trilogy as a whole) the traditional ceremonies of the Church form a backdrop to various criminal activities.
||('The Godfather' begins with a wedding and ends with a baptism).
||It seemed to me that Coppola was using these scenes to make an ironic contrast between the values of organised crime and those of Christianity, especially at the end of the film.
||Michael, already a 'godfather' in the metaphorical sense of a Mafia boss, becomes one in the literal sense of a baptismal sponsor.
||Shots of him taking vows on behalf of his godchild to reject the works of the devil are intercut with shots of his enemies being gunned down on his orders.Despite my reservations about this film, and although I personally would not have ranked it as my all-time favourite, there can be no denying that it is a film of great power and a milestone in the history of the cinema.

||The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say.
||What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall.
||This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies.
||With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight.
||His performance as the godfather alone is iconic.
||His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché.
||His performance though was not a cliché.
||His performance was subtle and breathtaking.
||It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself.
||Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well.
||What a way to start up your career.
||His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly.
||He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies.
||His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me.
||Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie.
||He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia.
||His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;.
||This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout.
||The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking.
||As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this.
||It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect.
||It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene.
||There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get.

||It's a tale of contempt and corruption, extortion and fraud and disruption, the dinosaurs roam, testosterone foams, below the streets, where the sewers and the rats run.The overwhelmingly brilliant performance comes from Marlon Brando, the rest of the cast essentially play themselves or a role they perpetually play, just watch any and all of their subsequent offerings.Does it work as well today? I'm not sure it survives the test of time as well as other films of the era or before, some of the editing jumps about erratically and women are generally treated like brood mares who live in ignorance of their surroundings - just as long as there's a good sing song, a dance, and a cake, at a christening or wedding even better.I fondly remember Edward G.

TheDonAndHisSons (10/10)
||My nephew who is all of 17 told me in no uncertain terms that movie making with him starts with The Godfather.
||He doesn't believe anything made before it is of any great merit.
||For him The Godfather is like The Birth of a Nation.
||All three of The Godfather films can bear viewing over and over again.
||Mario Puzo created such compelling characters and Francis Ford Coppola brought them to life so vividly that you just get sucked in permanently.
||Like that other mammoth novel about a period, Gone With the Wind, Mario Puzo was like Margaret Mitchell in that there was no way he could top himself after the book was published.Anyone steeped in organized crime history will know a lot about who is being alluded to in all of the Godfather films.
||Case in point, Alex Rocco who plays the minor character of Moe Green who takes it upon himself to slap Fredo Corleone around.
||He's also got a cash flow problem at the casino he's running.
||One would have to have been living on another planet to not know he was referring to Bugsy Siegal.The Godfather story begins at the end of World War II where Marlon Brando rules the roost as Vito Corleone head of one of the large crime families.
||Two sons, James Caan (Sonny) and John Cazale (Fredo) are in the business and the third Al Pacino (Michael) has just come back from the war a decorated hero.
||The occasion is the gathering of the clan and friends for daughter Talia Shire (Connie) to Gianni Rizzi (Carlo Russo).
||All the characters are marvelously introduced and the plot situations laid out beautifully.Marlon Brando who apparently decided that what George C.
||Scott did was so good in refusing the Oscar for Patton decided to do him one better and send up a bogus Indian princess to tell why.
||Despite that bit of cheek Brando certainly deserved an Oscar for his performance.
||Don Vito is compelling as criminal and family man.
||Brando might have been lucky though in that Al Pacino who really is the main character in all three Godfather films was nominated in the Supporting Actor category.In fact Pacino was nominated with James Caan and Robert Duvall who plays Tom Heggen the family lawyer/consigliere and Brando's adopted son.
||That three way tie guaranteed the Oscar for Joel Grey in Cabaret with Eddie Albert being nominated for The Heartbreak Kid as the fifth.
||They're all great, but Pacino should have been in The Best Actor category.Singer Al Martino plays Johnny Fontaine who if you didn't know that this was Frank Sinatra again you'd have to have been living on another planet.
||In fact the identification is made complete by the fact that Martino sings I Have But One Heart at the Corleone wedding which was an early Sinatra hit.
||Sinatra was not happy with The Godfather and broke off relations with Martino and with Richard Conte who plays Don Barzini one of the other Mafia Dons.
||Part of the underside of the Sinatra legend is worked into the plot as well.The images and dialog of The Godfather have entered into our popular culture.
||The horse's head in John Marley's bed, the cryptic gangster dialog of speaking of an "offer he can't refuse", or "Lucabrazzi sleeps with the fishes" is all stuff we remember forever after seeing the film.The key scene I think in The Godfather is between the retired Brando and Pacino who has taken over the crime family.
||Brando isn't happy about the road he took for success, but it's what was available to him.
||He hoped that Pacino could have stayed out of the family business and had a clean life.
||It wasn't to be, but maybe the next generation.
||I think it's beautifully played.In fact it's all beautifully played.

||This must rank as the best film (along with part 2)of all time.An ensemble performance that has no weak spot.Particularly, John Cazale ( Fredo) and Richard Castellano ( Clemenza) give wonderfully understated performances.
||You just have to believe that Castellano WAS Clemenza, he brings a real touch to his role.John Cazale brings the troubled Fredo to life, and you can see the weak Fredo desperately trying to live up to the family reputation but knowing that he can never be what his father wants.
||The story of one man's reluctance to be drawn into the murky family business,and his gradual change through circumstance, paints a vivid picture of this violent period of US history.Do not miss this film!
